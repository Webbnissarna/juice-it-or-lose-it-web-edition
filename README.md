## Levels of juice

1. Functionality
    * Plain html
    * Does the job
2. Formatting
    * Enter basic css
    * No fancy stuff but it gets some visual personality
3. Usability / semantics / accessibility
    * Not strictly associated with ARIA, but usability in the form of better descriptions in text etc
    * Hover effects etc
4. Motion
    * Here be fancy, motion enters the arena. We start to give things life
5. Interactivity
    * The application strikes back
    * Interacts with the user with more elaborate animations that happens due to user input
